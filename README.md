 Transforming Sources of Data, Exporting &amp; then Analyzing it, Searching for Discrepancies &amp; Trends


## Analysis
Based off my exploratory analysis, there is something off with our data. Thanks to Interquartile Ranges (IQR), we identified taht Whole Foods locations in the Kanas region seems to have incorrect pricing. I was able to locate the Auditor that made the mistake & would reccomend we do a full review of his prices throughout our data. 

Here are a few other reccomendations for data analysis if I had more time;
- Research N/A to find trends within each Banner & Region
- Remove outliers or use ML model to predict correct pricing for Whole Foods in Kansas
- Collect summary statistics for each Banner & Region
- Create and use multiplier model to predict prices
- Compare Banners by Region for trends
- Research least & most expensive products in each Banner & Region
- Look at unique UPC's by price
- Further Research Auditor's and potential discrepancies
